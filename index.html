							This Project is going to explore the potencial cities for young professionals in STEM major to live.</p>
					  <p class="lead2"><strong class = "fw-bold">"Where should I go after graduating from the program?"</strong> As a first-year graduate student looking into the upcoming hiring season, I often wonder.&nbsp;</p>
					  <p class="lead2">As a STEM-major student, it might be a "norm" to move to some STEM-centered cities: San Francisco, San Jose, or Seattle. However, along with great job opportunities, the living expenses and the housing prices in these cities are sky-rocketing. Are there any rising cities with much potential to provide great job opportunities to STEM students while having lower living expenses and better housing prices? Especially with the impacts of the COVID-19, many young people change their attitudes about purchasing a property. Real-estate investment is suitable for providing stability when the outside environment changes. Therefore, more young people are willing to purchase a property instead of renting, which makes the housing prices of a city a very important factor when people make moving decisions.</p>
						<p class="lead2">This project will look into 5 cities with STEM potentials, analyzing the housing price and growth rate for 2-Bedroom apartments and condos (two housing types that young professionals are most likely to choose when purchasing their first property), and compare the housing market of 5 potential STEM cities with 5 focus STEM centers: San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Boston. Hopefully, by the end of this analysis, people will be more familiar with STEM potential cities and will have a better understanding of where STEM students should move after graduation based on housing markets. </p>

Ten cities are included in this dataset, five of which are potential STEM cities, and the rest are famous STEM cities. The five potential STEM cities (Austin, Dallas, New York, Orlando, Miami) were selected by the top frequency of the combination of potential and technology cities from text analysis (explained in discussions). And the five well-known STEM cities (San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston) were selected based on the location of famous technology companies.</p>

In 2019, San Francisco's housing prices were even experiencing negative growth.&nbsp;</p>
						  		<p class="lead2">Meanwhile, compared to the five well-known STEM cities, the housing price growth rates in potential STEM cities have consistently increased since 2018. From 2019, the housing price growth rates have been maintained for the first place by Austin, Texas. And housing prices in other potential STEM cities, such as Miami and Orlando, have significantly increased since 2019.</p>

                        <h2>Discussion</h2>
                      <p class="lead2"><strong class="fw-bold">Question 1. How to find 5 Potential STEM Cities and correlate them with housing market potentials?</strong></p>
                      <p class="lead2">Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate how we find our five potential STEM cities. First, by using the term “potential cities,” we refer to cities with high economic growth that might provide many job opportunities, especially for young professionals. Housing prices are a significant economic indicator.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2">By calculating the average housing price growth rates in the last decade and observing the changes state by state (Figure 1), we were able to find a few states with increasing growth rates (the color change from lighter to darker). Two states with noticeable changes are Florida and Texas. Therefore, finding our potential cities in these two states would make sense.Moreover, our project wants to select potential cities with a STEM emphasis, as we all are STEM-major students. Text analysis was conducted to cross the city names in Google News under the keywords “potential cities in the US” and “technology cities in the US.” The word frequency was plotted to visualize heavily mentioned cities under two different key terms (Figure 2).&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2">Cities found to have high frequencies under both terms, combining the result that we found in Figure 1, two cities in Texas: Austin and Dallas, and two cities in Florida: Orlando and Miami, were selected to be potential cities. To our surprise, New York was the fifth city selected, with high popularity when people discussed “potential cities” and “technology cities.” New York has always been the financial center of the US. However, as many technology firms build their headquarters and shift part of their operations to New York, it would be interesting to see how New York shifts its focus and performs as a potential STEM city.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2"><strong class="fw-bold">Question 2. Are potential cities worthy of investing in comparison to STEM-centered cities?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2"> Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 analyze the average housing price growth rates from different perspectives.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2">Figure 3 ranks the 10 cities, 5 potential STEM cities, and 5 famous STEM cities by their average housing prices growth rate. This figure provides an overview of how the housing market changed in the last decade, including all housing types. From the graph, it can be seen that up until 2018, STEM-centered cities, for example, San Francisco and Seattle, were generating the highest growth rates. From 2019, potential STEM cities like Dallas and Austin will start to have higher growth rates. It might indicate that STEM-centered cities’ housing markets performed better in the early years. IN RECENT YEARS, the US housing market shifted its focus to potential STEM cities. However, we cannot generate valuable insights for our target audience by analyzing the average housing prices: young professionals. Therefore, we further narrow our research to two specific housing types: 2-Bedroom apartments and condos.</p>
                      <p class="lead2">Figure 4 and Figure 5 are two time-series heat maps showing housing price growth rates each month throughout the last 10 years for 2-Bedroom apartments and condos. The housing market for 2-Bedroom apartments and condos shows a similar pattern but is slightly different from the market for all housing types. Unlike the market for all housing types, which shifts the focus from STEM-centered cities to potential cities in 2019, the shifts in 2-Bedroom and condo markets are later. Some potential STEM cities, such as Austin, have a minimum average price growth rate until 2020 and become the city with the highest growth rate in 2021. Meanwhile, we can see that the STEM-centered cities were performing really severely:  A lot of which generated negative growth rates in 2021. It might result from the pandemic effect: people moved out of STEM-centered cities and avoided high prices when many companies announced “work from anywhere” policies. And it might be a forever change since some of the companies are not going to change their working styles back. It would be questionable whether there would be as many demands in well-known STEM cities and whether their growth rate in housing prices would go back to the pre-pandemic level.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2">Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that in the coming years, potential STEM cities will replace the positions of STEM-centered cities in the housing market, especially for 2-Bedroom apartments and condos. With no guarantee of the recovery of the housing prices growth rate, it might be smart for investors, especially young professionals, to invest in potential STEM cities.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2"><strong class="fw-bold">Question 3. What should we buy, 2-Bedroom apartments or condos? And, where should we buy, in potential cities?</strong></p>
                      <p class="lead2">Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 could answer this question.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2">Figure 6 focuses on the growth rate comparison between different housing types. The violin plot shows that the growth rates for 2-Bedroom apartments and condos are similar in range and shape across all cities. Therefore, it wouldn’t be very different for young professionals to purchase 2-Bedroom apartments or condos to generate returns in percentage.
                          Meanwhile, in Figure 8, by plotting and comparing the distributions of average housing prices for 2-Bedroom apartments and condos, we can see that purchasing an apartment is slightly more expensive than purchasing a condo. Therefore, if young professionals don’t have enough savings, it might be easier for them to purchase a condo from a financial point of view. 
                          Moreover, from Figure 7, it is observed that Austin stands out from the rest by generating a sky-rocket high growth rate in the second quarter of 2021. Although the growth rate experienced a sudden drop, it gradually increased and outbeated other cities by 2021. It is reasonable to assume that Austin would generate a solid housing price growth rate for both 2-Bedroom apartments and condos in the first two quarters of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2">At the same time, if you are looking to purchase properties in Austin, you probably need to prepare about 278K for an average two-bedroom apartment and 293K for an average condo, which is about 55K-58K for the down payment (considering 20% for a down payment).</p>
                      <p class="lead2">It might be a bit heavier for young professionals than other potential STEM cities (except New York), but considering the much higher growth rate and the profit you can generate from the investment. I would say it would be an excellent choice to move to Austin.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p class="lead2"><strong class="fw-bold">Question 4. What is a good time to buy, and what is a good time to sell?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="lead2">By observing the year-to-year heatmaps (Figures 4 and 5), the years on the left are generally darker than the years on the right. It might indicate “high seasons” in the left-side years and “low seasons” in the right-side years. Therefore, it might be wise for young professionals to purchase properties during a “low season” year and sell their properties in a “high season” year. The following “low season” year by prediction should be 2023 when we graduate from the DSAN program. It might be an excellent idea for us to think about moving and purchasing a property immediately.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class="lead2">STEM-major students think about moving to STEM-centered cities like San Jose or Seattle. Although everyone knows about the high living expenses and housing costs in these areas, many people find it unavoidable to move to these cities for more and better job opportunities. However, our analysis shows that the STEM cites expanded to more states, including Texas and Florida. The well-known, expensive cities are not the only choices with these expansions. In fact, with potential STEM cities just starting to grow in recent years, it is a perfect time for young professionals to move into cities like Austin or Dallas for equal opportunities but a much cheaper life.</p>
                        <p class="lead2">Meanwhile, the technology era also re-energized old financial centers, for example, New York.

Therefore, observing the housing market in these two cities might be the next step of our research. </p>
